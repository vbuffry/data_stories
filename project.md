# Part 1

## Outline
I plan to depict the nature of the racial wealth gap (particularly white-black) and explore factors that cause and compound this issue, ultimately discussing its implications on access to opportunity in the United States.

Problem Hook: Unequal income compounds when wealth can't transcend generations.

Outcome for reader: "As a reader, I want to understand the impact of compounding income inequality on quality of life (wealth) so that I can advocate for financial equity."

My hook is about those aspects of the "American Dream" that are out of reach for those cyclically poor. The concept of the American Dream provides some baseline that we believe Americans should be able to access (e.g stable, safe environment for children, good health, career opporunities, some leisure time). I would like to abstractly quantify what that costs (some have tried, e.g. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681136/Can-afford-American-Dream-Study-shows-ideal-lifestyle-costs-130-357-year.html">Daily Mail</a> in 2014).

## Data
Data on "wealth" will primarily come from the Census Bureau's reports on Wealth and Asset Ownership and Debt, data which covers pre-and-post 2008 (a turning point in the gap): https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/wealth/data/tables.All.html. I am particularly interested in the "net worth by race" data, but this is presented in a variety of forms, such as mean/median/mode, all of which offer a different impact. I am currently experimenting with how to visualize the main graphic. I then thought I might zoom in on data surrounding some of the correlated factors, such as equity in home, student debt, and income inequality. I would like to include all races in my main graph, with focus on the disparity between black and white. 

Some of my research suggests that the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequalty. The Census has data on that here: https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/data/data-tables.html. I believe it would be effective to include a visualization that depicts how much less one can expect to earn depending on race. This will be contextualized with research on how income relates to the wealth gap (see research in following)

## Method and Medium
I will portray my problem, story, and graphs in Shorthand. I have already started a page <a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/lIrvw9enoB97bu6z">here</a>.

In addition to the description in the first section, I would like to elaborate on my plan. First, I am in the process of conducting preliminary research to understand the nature, causes, and consequences of the racial wealth gap. I envision that I might need to narrow my scope even further, since the topic is a wide umbrella (as seen in my sketches). At the same time, it is difficult to isolate one of these factors since they operate together as a whole.

These are some of the sources that are informing my understanding of the issue:
https://www.thebalance.com/racial-wealth-gap-in-united-states-4169678 -- this is a great overview of the nature of the current problem, underpinned by historical context. I can pull some attention-grabbing statistics and narrative from this.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianthompson1/2018/02/18/the-racial-wealth-gap-addressing-americas-most-pressing-epidemic/#67e35b097a48 -- this article connects to other articles that review the topic.
https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/racial-wealth-gap-income-inequality-black-white-households/585325/ -- CityLab thinks the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequality. I can also use Census data to track that.

This week's reading in the Good Charts workbook highlighted some tactics that I found helpful for making persuasive visualizations. One was to "Lure" by upending expectations and creating a moment of psychological tension. This informed my decision to juxtapose some relatable idea like the American Dream with the reality. Many people have heard of the racial wealth gap but for this particular audience, it is something outside themselves which they have never experienced. To have a full impact, I need to have them transcend their paradigm and connect to the content that I am presenting. The narrative structure of the poverty cycle (always linking back to the wealth/income gap that underpins it) can help carry them on a journey through that alien space and give them a call to action to intervene with appropriate policy.

# Part 2

## Visualization scan and mood boards
I scanned the internet for other visualizations, including color schemes and mediums used to present such a topic.
<img src="https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_11096_racial_wealth_inequality_is_rampant_in_the_us_n.jpg" width="500"> Here is an example of a chart that tries to depict the specific phenomenon of the racial wealth gap. I found this chart less effective using lines as compared to the visualization styles that follow. I also found the colors did not evoke any particular meaning. I undertook to test both graph style and color in my user research.
I also went to <a href="https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/>Inequality.org</a> (who probably uses Shorthand) and noticed they use a lot of black, most likely to show the gravity of the situation. For comparison in charts, they use red and blue. The site <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wealth-inequality-problem-one-chart/>Visual Capitalist</a> attempts to "explain wealth inequality in one chart" also uses red and blue bars. The seventh (and following) charts on this <a href="https://inequality.stanford.edu/publications/20-facts-about-us-inequality-everyone-should-know>Stanford</a> blog uses the colors of the race to characterize their bars. I found this made it hard to see the white bars. 

My initial ideas were to use colors associated with finance, like greens, blacks, and reds. Aware of colorblindness, I will steer clear of using them in tandem. I plan to experiment with color schemes in my user research.

## User Research Protocol
With the recent debate surrounding <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/globelocal/2019/09/27/should-nation-provide-reparations-african-americans-for-slavery/EKQiZ7BsEhGQriylNHHKVI/story.html">reparations</a>, many Americans are contending with the extent to which policy should seek to rectify the long-lasting legacy of slavery and segregation in the United States. Despite abolition in the late 1880s, many states resisted implementation, with violence and segregation lasting to the modern day. (final project will go into more depth about factors like redlining, school bussing, etc). However, some Americans doubt that slavery and segregation have a lasting impact, believing that civil rights movements in the 60s rectified institutionalized racism, and blaming modern challenges on factors like poor work ethic. 

I seek to persuade a general audience about the reason why these differences matter and the extent to which one's environment, in this case largely shaped by the legacy of slavery and segregation, determine one's outcomes. In particular, I am targeting the racial wealth gap, which is a way to quanitfy the compounding impact of inequality over time.

<b>a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story</b>
To draw loose categories around this population, I've identified the following groups on a simplified "spectrum of sympathy": 
*Most Sympathetic* Those who are strong advocates for racial equality and proactively seek change<----Those who sympathize but do not go out of their way to effect change beyond basic actions like voting---Those who are ambivalent, not taking action in either direction---Those who feel abstractly threatened by equity policy and do not actively block action but would not vote in its favor---> Those who vehemently oppose equity legislation and take action to hinder its actualization, i.e. *Least Sympathetic*

In other words, it's a spectrum between *Pre-persuaded*<----To be persuaded--Don't care--Might be persuaded-->*Won't be persuaded in this lifetime*. I intend to target those surrounding the center, for those on the left it can resonate and tip them to action. For those on the right-of-center, it might present new compelling information that will directly motivate a proactive action, but can mitigate contradictory action. 

<b>b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview</b>
People toward the middle of the above spectrum are those who typically do not wear their political opinions on their sleeves. I want to avoid people on either end of the spectrum, so I decided to suss out where people fall by asking a preliminary question: *would you describe yourself as having vehement feelings about the issue of racial equity?* before proceeding with the others. As a general rule, I am trying to stick to longer term residents in America, who I believe have a larger stake in the issue and are more likely to have the interest and ability to vote or pursue other action. Furthermore, race is a touchy topic and it can make people uncomfortable to share their true position to an interviewer, resulting in a positive bias. For that reason, I decided to interview my father as a representative sample of right-of-center, since our family relationship means he will not feel the need to filter. I tried to find another less sympathetic candidate, as well as at least two in the other categories, making for 6 total.

<b>c. your interview script</b>
1) My first task is to identify where the subject falls on the general spectrum above (and also whether new categories need to exist). After screening for extremes, the next step is to understand whether they are generally sympathetic, ambivalent, or non-sympathetic. 
2) Second, I asked them to what extent they felt they knew "a lot about the issue". This question is aimed at understanding whether information might confirm understanding or surprise.
3) I want to experiment with presenting key information in different ways to understand which is most persuasive to the audience member given their position. I sampled my key information about median wealth across different wireframe visualization types. This did not test for color but just for chart style.
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwCwHDyK/barsall.jpg"><br>
4) I also did preliminary experiments with colors:
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRVZ2xcg/colors.jpg"><br> I wanted to experiment with some more professional "fidciary" color schemes to try to lend credibility to a financial comparison, wondering if that would trigger someone to manifest how they consider their own net worth. I also experimented with dramatic colors like black and red, and finally with more primary colors that I felt showed more contrast.
5) I asked what other evidence the subject would find most meaningful to painting a picture of how inequity compounds. e.g. educational outcomes and how those are passed on? type and size of investments? income? health? to make this easier to answer, I started by showing a few sample charts from Raj Chetty's work <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty2.png" width="300"> or <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty14.png" width="300"> or <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty12.png" width="300"> which is related to <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty11.png" width="300">. The outcomes of this discussion would inform where I should prioritize my other visualizations and the narrative built around them.

<b>d. the findings from your interviews; and changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.</b>
1) When interviewing around campus, it was easiest to find people who were left-of-center. These people tended to believe that it racial inequality was a generally important issue and had a general amount of knowledge. After a few attempts, it became clear to me that it was not particularly useful to ask someone the first question because nobody was going to admit if they were non-sympathetic, so I was glad that the second question put me back on more neutral, less-loaded territory... 
2) I used this question as a proxy for sympathy. Digging deeper, the closer a subject was toward 'ambivalent', the more likely it was that they had heard about the topic from headlines or buzz words but did not have the time to dig deeper since it was a "complex" issue and it would require a lot of effort. Some other people said they cared but didn't know what to do about it (i.e., how to translate that care into action). On the right side, I deduced from my interview with  my father that one is more likely to feel justified to take a contrary stance to the issue if they could somehow compartmentalize it as a politicized issue and not reflective of reality. In other words, he said he separated "left wing propoganda" from "the truth" and "the truth" in his situation was based on his experience (very limited) which was echoed in the types of media he reads, which therefore meant that his news source was more "true." As you can imagine, this was quickly going down a rabbit hole that led me to realize that I cannot suit all these different stances with a one-size-fits-all approach. This, combined with the results of the 5th question (which were ALL over the place), indicated I needed to more finely scope both my audience AND the angle I was going to take on the net worth gap. 

<b>*take two*</b>
I ended up going back to square one and decided to focus on my professional activity around financial counseling services for low-income (usually African American) individuals. I decided to scope the topics around those financial activities which counseling centers can impact (e.g. types of loans, investments, and spending habits). I then decided to scope my audience to those who design financial counseling offerings to try to shape the nature and content of their training and services. I reached out to the program manager of one our centers and ran some of my design ideas past her. I also reached out to another colleague who decides what trainings to send counselors to. I asked them to think about what would persuade them to change their current approach. I also asked them to think about what would persuade funders that their change was justified (and would therefore promote further investment). In the short window of my turn around, I did not have time to reach out to a funder.

3) Here the chart style that was most preferred was the bar charts or area chart because it showed "volume" which is how the program managers tended to think about net worth. I had intentionally left a gap for 2012 and no gap between 2005 and 2009 because I wanted to ask how bothersome gaps were to the viewer. They both felt that gaps were necessary but not persuasive, so one encouraged that I cut out 2005 or use bar charts. I made a mental note that it may not even be meaningful to tell a story over time if there wasn't enough time to show a pervasive trend OR a time-related element (like 2008) to focus on. I'll need to look again to see if I can find other data sources.

4) Color: Some feedback here included: Lighter colors on the bottom faded into background, but too light on top and you risk the same effect. The black/red color scheme seemed most emotionally-triggering, but almost too much, where they suspected over-dramatization and manipulation. Black color was also confusing because it represented white data, BUT drew the eye more than alternatives. The top right light green/black seemed to be most liked, though could use some work.

5) Here they were most interested in those aspects which impacted networth which a financial counselor is able to impact, such as saving for college or retirement, home ownership, loans, etc. One imagined this could send a signal to funders that they are proactively targetting data-backed gaps that can lead to more racial equity. They also asked for information relevant to Pittsburgh's financial needs. If time permits, I can look beyond national-level census data and see if there is any Pittsburgh-level data, perhaps using GIS.

## Story Arc
There is a way that financial counseling programs can serve as a front line against the racial wealth gap.
We need to be educated about the particular challenges black customers face...
