# About Me
Hi, I'm Vanessa (MSPPM-3). This is a picture of me with my daughter, Elinor (2), and my husband, Guillaume, who currently works as the Manager of Business Analytics at Gateway Health.

I was born in Irvine California, grew up in Denver, CO, and got my BA in International Relations at American University in Washington, DC. From there I moved to Eastern Europe, where I got an MA in History at the Central European University in Budapest. After graduating, I went on to teach a globalized version of history in Czech Republic's foremost high school near Prague, CZ. After 4 years of that incredible experience, I was looking to expand my career toward shaping a great future through effective policy interventions.
I just needed to round out the quantitative element of my education-- which brought me to Heinz!
When I'm not at school or with my family, I work as a strategy and resource development consultant. My specialty is to help non-profits convert into social enterprises, or at least to manage their limited resources to maximum social effect. I really like this role and will probably continue in this capacity after I graduate this December.
