# Part 1

## Outline
I plan to depict the nature of the racial wealth gap and explore factors that cause and compound this issue, ultimately discussing its implications on access to opportunity in the United States.

Problem Hook: Unequal income compounds when wealth can't transcend generations.

Outcome for reader: "As a reader, I want to understand the impact of compounding income inequality on quality of life (wealth) so that I can advocate for financial equity."

My hook is about those aspects of the "American Dream" that are out of reach for those cyclically poor. The concept of the American Dream provides some baseline that we believe Americans should be able to access (e.g stable, safe environment for children, good health, career opporunities, some leisure time). I would like to abstractly quantify what that costs (some have tried, e.g. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681136/Can-afford-American-Dream-Study-shows-ideal-lifestyle-costs-130-357-year.html">Daily Mail</a> in 2014).

Ideas: Sample projectile of American Dream, overlaid with annual net worth or income data?

## Data
Data on "wealth" will primarily come from the Census Bureau's reports on Wealth and Asset Ownership and Debt, data which covers pre-and-post 2008 (a turning point in the gap): https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/wealth/data/tables.All.html

Some of my research suggests that the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequalty. The Census has data on that here: https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/data/data-tables.html

## Method and Medium
I will portray my problem, story, and graphs in Shorthand. I have already started a page <a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/lIrvw9enoB97bu6z">here</a>.

These are some of the sources that are informing my understanding of the issue:
https://www.thebalance.com/racial-wealth-gap-in-united-states-4169678 -- this is a great overview of the nature of the current problem, underpinned by historical context. I can pull some attention-grabbing statistics and narrative from this.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianthompson1/2018/02/18/the-racial-wealth-gap-addressing-americas-most-pressing-epidemic/#67e35b097a48 -- this article connects to other articles that review the topic.
https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/racial-wealth-gap-income-inequality-black-white-households/585325/ -- CityLab thinks the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequality. I can also use Census data to track that.
