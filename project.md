# Part 1

## Outline
I plan to depict the nature of the "racial wealth gap" and discuss its implications on access to opportunity in the United States.
Problem Hook: Is the American Dream available for all?

Outcome for reader: As a reader, I want to understand the impact of compounding financial difficulty on quality of life so that I can advocate for financial equity.

My hook is about the basic building blocks of the "American Dream," which provide some baseline that we believe Americans should be able to access (e.g stable, safe environment for children, good health, career opporunities, some leisure time). I would like to abstractly quantify what that costs (some have tried, e.g. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681136/Can-afford-American-Dream-Study-shows-ideal-lifestyle-costs-130-357-year.html">Daily Mail</a> in 2014). 

## Initial Sketches

Ideas: Sample projectile of American Dream, overlaid with annual net worth or income data?

## Data
Data will primarily come from the Census Bureau's reports on Wealth and Asset Ownership and Debt, data which covers pre-and-post 2008 (a turning point in the gap): https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/wealth/data/tables.All.html

## Method and Medium
I will portray my problem, story, and graphs in Shorthand. I have already started a page <a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/lIrvw9enoB97bu6z">here</a>.
