# Part 1: The Idea

## Outline
I plan to depict the nature of the racial wealth gap (particularly white-black) and explore factors that cause and compound this issue, ultimately discussing its implications on access to opportunity in the United States.

Problem Hook: Unequal income compounds when wealth can't transcend generations.

Outcome for reader: "As a reader, I want to understand the impact of compounding income inequality on quality of life (wealth) so that I can advocate for financial equity."

My hook is about those aspects of the "American Dream" that are out of reach for those cyclically poor. The concept of the American Dream provides some baseline that we believe Americans should be able to access (e.g stable, safe environment for children, good health, career opporunities, some leisure time). I would like to abstractly quantify what that costs (some have tried, e.g. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681136/Can-afford-American-Dream-Study-shows-ideal-lifestyle-costs-130-357-year.html">Daily Mail</a> in 2014).

## Data
Data on "wealth" will primarily come from the Census Bureau's reports on Wealth and Asset Ownership and Debt, data which covers pre-and-post 2008 (a turning point in the gap): https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/wealth/data/tables.All.html. I am particularly interested in the "net worth by race" data, but this is presented in a variety of forms, such as mean/median/mode, all of which offer a different impact. I am currently experimenting with how to visualize the main graphic. I then thought I might zoom in on data surrounding some of the correlated factors, such as equity in home, student debt, and income inequality. I would like to include all races in my main graph, with focus on the disparity between black and white. 

Some of my research suggests that the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequalty. The Census has data on that here: https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/data/data-tables.html. I believe it would be effective to include a visualization that depicts how much less one can expect to earn depending on race. This will be contextualized with research on how income relates to the wealth gap (see research in following)

## Method and Medium
I will portray my problem, story, and graphs in Shorthand. I have already started a page <a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/lIrvw9enoB97bu6z">here</a>.

In addition to the description in the first section, I would like to elaborate on my plan. First, I am in the process of conducting preliminary research to understand the nature, causes, and consequences of the racial wealth gap. I envision that I might need to narrow my scope even further, since the topic is a wide umbrella (as seen in my sketches). At the same time, it is difficult to isolate one of these factors since they operate together as a whole.

These are some of the sources that are informing my understanding of the issue:
https://www.thebalance.com/racial-wealth-gap-in-united-states-4169678 -- this is a great overview of the nature of the current problem, underpinned by historical context. I can pull some attention-grabbing statistics and narrative from this.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianthompson1/2018/02/18/the-racial-wealth-gap-addressing-americas-most-pressing-epidemic/#67e35b097a48 -- this article connects to other articles that review the topic.
https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/racial-wealth-gap-income-inequality-black-white-households/585325/ -- CityLab thinks the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequality. I can also use Census data to track that.

This week's reading in the Good Charts workbook highlighted some tactics that I found helpful for making persuasive visualizations. One was to "Lure" by upending expectations and creating a moment of psychological tension. This informed my decision to juxtapose some relatable idea like the American Dream with the reality. Many people have heard of the racial wealth gap but for this particular audience, it is something outside themselves which they have never experienced. To have a full impact, I need to have them transcend their paradigm and connect to the content that I am presenting. The narrative structure of the poverty cycle (always linking back to the wealth/income gap that underpins it) can help carry them on a journey through that alien space and give them a call to action to intervene with appropriate policy.

# Part 2: Design and User Research

## Visualization scan and mood boards
I scanned the internet for other visualizations, including color schemes and mediums used to present such a topic.
<img src="https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_11096_racial_wealth_inequality_is_rampant_in_the_us_n.jpg" width="500"> Here is an example of a chart that tries to depict the specific phenomenon of the racial wealth gap. I found this chart less effective using lines as compared to visualizations like bars. I also found the colors did not evoke any particular meaning. 
I also went to <a href="https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/>Inequality.org</a> (who probably uses Shorthand) and noticed they use a lot of black, most likely to show the gravity of the situation. For comparison in charts, they use red and blue. The site <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wealth-inequality-problem-one-chart/>Visual Capitalist</a> attempts to "explain wealth inequality in one chart" also uses red and blue bars. The seventh chart on this <a href="https://inequality.stanford.edu/publications/20-facts-about-us-inequality-everyone-should-know>Stanford blog</a> uses the colors of the race to characterize their bars. I found this made it hard to see the white bars. 

My initial ideas were to use colors associated with finance, like greens, blacks, and reds. Aware of colorblindness, I will steer clear of using them in tandem. I undertook to test both graph style and color in my user research.

## User Research Protocol
With the recent debate surrounding <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/globelocal/2019/09/27/should-nation-provide-reparations-african-americans-for-slavery/EKQiZ7BsEhGQriylNHHKVI/story.html">reparations</a>, many Americans are contending with the extent to which policy should seek to rectify the long-lasting legacy of slavery and segregation in the United States. The particular element I wanted to examine was the racial wealth gap, which quantifies this phenomenon. There are so many different causes and consequences of the racial wealth gap that it requires a complex and multi-pronged approach from public, private, and individual actors alike.

My original approach was to try to persuade a 'general audience' about why these differences matter and the extent to which one's environment, in this case largely shaped by the legacy of slavery and segregation, determine one's outcomes. After an initial user research protocol yielded scatter results, I ended up going back to square one, deciding to focus on my professional activity around financial counseling services for low-income (usually African American) individuals. 

<b>a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story</b>
I scoped my angle on the wealth gap to include topics which counseling centers can impact (e.g. types of loans, investments, and spending habits). I then decided to scope my audience to those who design financial counseling offerings to try to shape the nature and content of their training and services. 

<b>b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview</b>
I reached out to the program manager of one our centers and ran some of my design ideas past her. I also reached out to another colleague who decides what trainings to send counselors to. I asked them to think about what would persuade them to change their current approach. I also asked them to think about what would persuade funders that their change was justified (and would therefore promote further investment). In the short window of my turn around, I did not have time to reach out to a funder.

<b>c. your interview script</b>
1) I wanted to experiment with presenting key information in different ways to understand which is most persuasive to the audience member given their position. I sampled my key information about median wealth across different wireframe visualization types. This did not test for color but just for chart style.
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwCwHDyK/barsall.jpg"><br>
4) I also did preliminary experiments with colors:
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRVZ2xcg/colors.jpg"><br> I wanted to experiment with some more professional "fidciary" color schemes to try to lend credibility to a financial comparison, wondering if that would trigger someone to manifest how they consider their own net worth. I also experimented with dramatic colors like black and red, and finally with more primary colors that I felt showed more contrast.
5) I asked what other evidence the subject would find most meaningful to painting a picture of how inequity compounds. e.g. educational outcomes and how those are passed on? type and size of investments? income? health? to make this easier to answer, I started by showing a few sample charts from Raj Chetty's work <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty2.png" width="300"> or <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty14.png" width="300"> or <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty12.png" width="300"> which is related to <img src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/es_20180110_chetty11.png" width="300">. The outcomes of this discussion would inform where I should prioritize my other visualizations and the narrative built around them.

<b>d. the findings from your interviews; and changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.</b>
1) Here the chart style that was most preferred was the bar charts or area chart because it showed "volume" which is how the program managers tended to think about net worth. I had intentionally left a gap for 2012 and no gap between 2005 and 2009 because I wanted to ask how bothersome gaps were to the viewer. They both felt that gaps were necessary but not persuasive, so one encouraged that I cut out 2005 or use bar charts. I made a mental note that it may not even be meaningful to tell a story over time if there wasn't enough time to show a pervasive trend OR a time-related element (like 2008) to focus on. I'll need to look again to see if I can find other data sources.

2) Color: Some feedback here included: Lighter colors on the bottom faded into background, but too light on top and you risk the same effect. The black/red color scheme seemed most emotionally-triggering, but almost too much, where they suspected over-dramatization and manipulation. Black color was also confusing because it represented white data, BUT drew the eye more than alternatives. The top right light green/black seemed to be most liked, though could use some work.

3) Here they were most interested in those aspects which impacted networth which a financial counselor is able to impact, such as saving for college or retirement, home ownership, loans, etc. One imagined this could send a signal to funders that they are proactively targetting data-backed gaps that can lead to more racial equity. They also asked for information relevant to Pittsburgh's financial needs. If time permits, I can look beyond national-level census data and see if there is any Pittsburgh-level data, perhaps using GIS.


# Part 3: Final Data Story

## Appealing to my audience of financial counselors
When building an effective presentation, perhaps the most important element is to "know your audience." Despite the challenges I faced scoping my project, I was glad that I had narrowed it down to a defined group: low-income financial counselors. Thankfully, this is a group that I know well from my professional work designing and running a variety of counseling centers in Pittsburgh through Neighborhood Allies (FOCs, FECs, and AFC). I spend a lot of time thinking about how our financial counseling approach should be more reflective of the needs of our target population. We train our counselors in nationally standardized curriculum, but we must go one step further and inculcate them with racial sensitivity training and trauma-informed approaches to counseling. While this project did not go into the weeds of those behavioral approaches, I was inspired by the idea of responding to one of the actual inquiries we receive about how to replicate our model in other cities. I often find that the first step is to make program developers and counselors intuitively aware of the barriers they are up against, so they don't get discouraged when the traditional models from their courses and textbooks fall flat. On an even more precise level, my audience ended up being further scoped to those who are in the early steps of adapting their counseling services.

## Design Decisions: A Journey
You'll notice that my color scheme and volume-oriented design choices were directly informed by my user research. I ended up using a forest green for Whites and a dark gray color for Blacks. I believe this has the effect of looking like a "mountain of money" juxtaposed with a contrasting color which can be intuitively linked with racial characteristic of my charts' focus. I made the graphs in Tableau, which has become my favorite data visualization tool. I needed to use Tableau because the others (such as RAW) did not permit the level of data filtering and cleaning that was necessary with the Census tables I had to use. For example, I often had to extract and combine data from multiple larger tables comparing other races and demographic buckets-- over time-- and even run my own analytics on these. For example, I had median net worth data and percent of net worth invested, but had to calculate what those percents end up meaning in terms of dollar amounts. I did this in Excel first and then brought it over to Tableau for final cleaning.

To eliminate extra verbage, text, and supporting details, I opted to summarize key impacts and explanations with succinct statements that were hyperlinked to deeper information. This had the dual purpose of taking care of my citations. This eliminated vestigial text and let the "data speak for itself."

This was the first time I was educated to take care to use legally-licensed images. I can't believe I went my whole life through (way too much) academia and this class was the first to tell me how to properly source images. I used the library's toolkit and found the best images on Unsplash. It felt right to credit the photographers for their hard work-- I would certainly want to give permission and receive recognition for my work!

Overall I am quite proud of the minimalist aspects of my work. I just wish Tableau would have cooperate when embedding my graphs!
