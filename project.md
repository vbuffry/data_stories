# Part 1

## Outline
I plan to depict the nature of the racial wealth gap (particularly white-black) and explore factors that cause and compound this issue, ultimately discussing its implications on access to opportunity in the United States.

Problem Hook: Unequal income compounds when wealth can't transcend generations.

Outcome for reader: "As a reader, I want to understand the impact of compounding income inequality on quality of life (wealth) so that I can advocate for financial equity."

My hook is about those aspects of the "American Dream" that are out of reach for those cyclically poor. The concept of the American Dream provides some baseline that we believe Americans should be able to access (e.g stable, safe environment for children, good health, career opporunities, some leisure time). I would like to abstractly quantify what that costs (some have tried, e.g. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681136/Can-afford-American-Dream-Study-shows-ideal-lifestyle-costs-130-357-year.html">Daily Mail</a> in 2014).

## Data
Data on "wealth" will primarily come from the Census Bureau's reports on Wealth and Asset Ownership and Debt, data which covers pre-and-post 2008 (a turning point in the gap): https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/wealth/data/tables.All.html. I am particularly interested in the "net worth by race" data, but this is presented in a variety of forms, such as mean/median/mode, all of which offer a different impact. I am currently experimenting with how to visualize the main graphic. I then thought I might zoom in on data surrounding some of the correlated factors, such as equity in home, student debt, and income inequality. I would like to include all races in my main graph, with focus on the disparity between black and white. 

Some of my research suggests that the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequalty. The Census has data on that here: https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/data/data-tables.html. I believe it would be effective to include a visualization that depicts how much less one can expect to earn depending on race. This will be contextualized with research on how income relates to the wealth gap (see research in following)

## Method and Medium
I will portray my problem, story, and graphs in Shorthand. I have already started a page <a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/lIrvw9enoB97bu6z">here</a>.

In addition to the description in the first section, I would like to elaborate on my plan. First, I am in the process of conducting preliminary research to understand the nature, causes, and consequences of the racial wealth gap. I envision that I might need to narrow my scope even further, since the topic is a wide umbrella (as seen in my sketches). At the same time, it is difficult to isolate one of these factors since they operate together as a whole.

These are some of the sources that are informing my understanding of the issue:
https://www.thebalance.com/racial-wealth-gap-in-united-states-4169678 -- this is a great overview of the nature of the current problem, underpinned by historical context. I can pull some attention-grabbing statistics and narrative from this.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianthompson1/2018/02/18/the-racial-wealth-gap-addressing-americas-most-pressing-epidemic/#67e35b097a48 -- this article connects to other articles that review the topic.
https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/racial-wealth-gap-income-inequality-black-white-households/585325/ -- CityLab thinks the wealth gap is most closely linked to income inequality. I can also use Census data to track that.

This week's reading in the Good Charts workbook highlighted some tactics that I found helpful for making persuasive visualizations. One was to "Lure" by upending expectations and creating a moment of psychological tension. This informed my decision to juxtapose some relatable idea like the American Dream with the reality. Many people have heard of the racial wealth gap but for this particular audience, it is something outside themselves which they have never experienced. To have a full impact, I need to have them transcend their paradigm and connect to the content that I am presenting. The narrative structure of the poverty cycle (always linking back to the wealth/income gap that underpins it) can help carry them on a journey through that alien space and give them a call to action to intervene with appropriate policy.
